# kinetic-media-ingest
MODULE : MEDIA_ACQUISITION_01 ] - Automated Python-based Selenium/PyAudio bridge for high-fidelity hardware-level signal acquisition and bypass verification.

[ MODULE : KINETIC_MEDIA_INGEST ]
[ OVERVIEW ]
This repository contains a specialized automation framework designed to bridge web-layer interfaces with system-level hardware buffers. Utilizing Selenium for navigation and PyAudio for ingest, the module enables the acquisition of high-fidelity 44100Hz audio data directly from the system's "Stereo Mix".

[ CAPABILITIES ]
Web Automation: Handling dynamic content loading and execution timing via Selenium.

Hardware Ingest: Direct indexing of system audio channels for real-time recording.

Signal Processing: Conversion of raw audio frames into standard .wav technical records.

[ PREREQUISITES ]
